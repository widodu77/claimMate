# 🚀 Quick Start - ClaimMate Demo

## ✅ **Ready to Test Right Now!**

The application is now running in **Demo Mode** - you can test all features without setting up Supabase!

### **How to Test:**

1. **Visit the application:** `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Submit a claim:** Click "Start Free Trial" → Fill out the form → Submit
3. **View claims:** Click "My Claims" in the header
4. **Update status:** Use the dropdown to change claim status

### **Demo Mode Features:**

✅ **Claim Submission** - Submit claims with text and files  
✅ **Claims List** - View all submitted claims  
✅ **Status Management** - Update claim status (pending → solved/opposed/closed)  
✅ **File Upload** - Attach multiple documents  
✅ **Real-time Updates** - Changes reflect immediately  

### **Demo Mode Limitations:**

⚠️ **Data is temporary** - Claims are stored in memory and will be lost when you refresh  
⚠️ **No persistence** - No database storage until Supabase is configured  
⚠️ **No file storage** - Files are simulated (not actually uploaded)

2. **Follow the setup guide** in `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
3. **Update your `.env` file** with real Supabase credentials
4. **Run database migrations** to create the claims table

### **Current Status:**

## 🎯 **What You Can Do Now:**

2. **Verify functionality** - All features work in demo mode
3. **Show to stakeholders** - Demonstrate the complete workflow
